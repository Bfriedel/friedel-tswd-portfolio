# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

You can view my wireframed story on [Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/lRTrIqEY1pAI1Q4h).

# User research 

## Target audience
> Include your approach to identifying representative individuals, and who you hope to reach with your story. 

My target audience is anyone above the age of 16 in the United States. This includes people of voting age ans well as those who will be of voting age within two years as these are the people who will be able to influence their Congress People and who the Congress People should be representative of. If they are informed of possible corruption happening at the highest levels, why

| Questions               | Male, late 50s | Female, mid 20s | Female, late 50s |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you have any prior knowledge of insider trading and if so, what? | Yes, I have read a lot about this topic  | Yes, I know it's an issue but don't know many details  | No, I don't know anything about trading stocks or what Congress has to do with it  |
| Do you understand what the issue is as I am presenting it? | Yes     | Yes   |  Yes   |
| Is there anything else you would want to see? (Perhaps a case study on a "bad trade" where the Congress Person was not found guilty)  | No, I know that happens all the time | Yes, specifically I want to see the case of the COVID vaccine companies since that was in the news |  Yes.    |
| Is there anything else you would want to see? | I want to know why the SEC can't do more. I understand they have a ot of data to look at, but we are in the age of AI so it seems that meeting minutes could be fed into a large language model and we should be able to look at timelines of discussions in subcommittee meetings and then stock trades that are being done with that information. Why is all of this analysis being done by hand? (I did not have an answer for this other than that there are companies that do these kinds of analyses every year including Unusual Whales and Quiver Quantitative.  | Just a case study   | Just an example of trades where the laws were not enforced  |
| Did this information make you feel any strong emotions?  | I'm just confused as to why more is not being done because we know this is happening. This seems like a missed opportunity for implementing some machine learning models. I am unhappy with the end result being that you need to call your congressman. I want to see the rules enforced. | Yes, these people are corrupt.   | Yes, this is crazy.   |
| Do you think Congress People should be allowed to trade stocks?  |  No, but I don't think the solution to this problem includes banning trades for their spouses and dependent children. At that point it seems that you are infringing on the rights of private citizens.  | No, they're all corrupt. | No, they are corrupt.  |



# Identified changes for Part III
> Document the changes you plan on implementing next week to address any issues identified.

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Everyone, regardless of previous exposure to the topic, was ok with the amount of background information provided, but I was asked a lot of questions about why the SEC cannot enforce the rules if they know insider trading is happening | In both of these cases, I described the one arrest that was made within the past 10 years and that they were only able to indict the Congress Person when he confessed to the crime and I will be adding this case study to the story to add context for how hard it is to enforce |
| Those with more exposure to the topic previously were more interested in why, given all of this data, is there not a way to screen trades better.  | I will possibly include an Alternative Outlook section which includes how my analysis was done which could be implemented in some model. |
|        |        |


> ...include any final thoughts you have here. 

The data cleaning and processing for this project was more than I anticipated and I have a new appreciation for how much work goes into saying something is insider trading without being in the room. I am using low estimates for my data (my relational database tying committees to market industries is based solely off of the top 20 industries that contribute to Congress People on Committees. I may change this if Ii find a better way moving forward, but other than going through every bill or press release, or going through every committee's jurisdiction, and making a judgment call as to what industries were affected, I think this is the most factual way to say one committee influences one industry.
