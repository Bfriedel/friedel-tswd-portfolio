# About me
I am a second year student in CMU's MISM-BIDA program, graduating in May of 2024. I am from the East Coast of the US and I love to read books and hang out with my two dogs.

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to create a new way of thinking for how best to present data, past just presenting bars and charts. I would like to learn a data journalism approach of how to best frame out the data to create a narrative. I am also interested in learning the basics of different tools, including Tableau and Shorthand.
