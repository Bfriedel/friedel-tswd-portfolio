# Outline
> Summary
> In 2012, Congress passed the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which required that members of Congress report stock trades made by themselves or family within 45 days of the trade. This act was designed to combat insider trading following heavy volumes of trades made by members of congress
> In my final project, I am interested in showing how Congress People's stock trades could potentially conflict with the committees that they are on. For around two years on Tik Tok, some creators have established their platform on the basis of tracking Congress peoples' stock trades and highlighting certain trades and bills that could potentially be conflicts of interest. Last year, the New York Times did an analysis on all trades within and found 97 members of Congress that have made potentially conflicting trades based on the committees that they are on. 

Project Structure:


> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

- Introduction to stocks and insider trading
- STOCK Act requirements
- arrests since STOCK act and why it's hard to prove insider trading
- view trades values
- view which members have made potentially conflicting trades
- view the values of these trades
- congress stock performance versus american people stock performance (especially during COVID)


## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
