## General Government Debt

The General government debt-to-GDP ratio is an important gauge that shows how much money the government owes in relation to the overall size of the country's economy. This ratio helps us understand if the government's finances are on a stable path.

To calculate this ratio, we add up different types of government debt, including things like money in the bank, loans, bonds, and other financial obligations. Then, we compare this total debt to the total value of the country's economic output, which is represented by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

When the government's debt-to-GDP ratio increases over time, it usually means that the government has been running budget deficits in the past, spending more money than it collects in revenue. This can raise concerns about the government's ability to manage its finances sustainably.

I chose illustrate a snapshot of the GDP-to-debt ratio rather than showing it over time just to show how the countries compare to each other in 2021. Showing the ratio over time is helpful in seeing how individual countries have changed over time, but providing a snapshot of the most recent data allows us to more easily compare the countries to each other than the sparklines. 

I selected just the countries of Europe as a subset of the data since that data is mostly complete, whereas if I had chosen a different region, it would be mostly empty. 

I chose the color scale 'inferno' to show that an increased GDP-to-debt ratio is bad for a country, as it can raise concerns about the government's ability to manage its finances sustainably.
