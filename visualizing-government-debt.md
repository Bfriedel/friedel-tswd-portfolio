The General government debt-to-GDP ratio is an important gauge that shows how much money the government owes in relation to the overall size of the country's economy. This ratio helps us understand if the government's finances are on a stable path.

To calculate this ratio, we add up different types of government debt, including things like money in the bank, loans, bonds, and other financial obligations. Then, we compare this total debt to the total value of the country's economic output, which is represented by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).

When the government's debt-to-GDP ratio increases over time, it usually means that the government has been running budget deficits in the past, spending more money than it collects in revenue. This can raise concerns about the government's ability to manage its finances sustainably.
